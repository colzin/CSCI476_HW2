##Collin Moore Memo for HW2
I have used linux before a little, but not github. The following is my story...
  So the assignment was to crack an ssh login, using whatever. We had Kali linux so I searched the web
for how to crack ssh on kali. I read about the tool hydra that can crack with multiple threads and
that sounded cool, so I opened the gui version so I could read about it.
  When it made sense I used the command-line version because everyone seems to say it is waay more 
1337 and powerful. 
  The following shot is the command I used.

I noticed that a lot of the children or threads hydra starts would fail, but 2 to 4 would usually keep working.
I tried two wordlists with no success, until the password was changed, then the list fasttrack.txt 
found it almost immediately to be changeme.
Here is a screenshot of the crack and successful login.
